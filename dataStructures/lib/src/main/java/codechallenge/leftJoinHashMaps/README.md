# Left Join Hashmaps Challenge

## Description

In the world of databases, a "left join" retrieves full records from one table along with matching records (where present) from another table. If no match is found, the result is rendered as NULL. Adapting this concept for hashmaps, the `LeftJoinHashMaps` challenge seeks to merge two hashmaps in line with the LEFT JOIN principle.

The main task can be found within the `LeftJoinHashMaps.java` file, located at: `./dataStructures/lib/src/main/java/codechallenge/leftJoinHashMaps/LeftJoinHashMaps.java`
