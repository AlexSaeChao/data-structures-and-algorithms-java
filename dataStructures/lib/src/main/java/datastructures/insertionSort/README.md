# InsertSort
Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted list one element at a time. It's similar to the way most people arrange a hand of playing cards. In this blog, I'll try to break down the insertion sort algorithm using a visual step-by-step guide for a better understanding, yours and mines.

## Approach & Efficiency
Depending on how large the input is in worst case time could be O(n^2), lets say that if all the values are sorted in the wrong order you, and you have 10 values you could be checking all the values with each other to make the total checks 100 times.
